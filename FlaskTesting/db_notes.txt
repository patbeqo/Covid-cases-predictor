SQLAlchemy with sqlite & RESTful API notes

DataBase --->

//Adding to database
	db.session.add(model_name)	db is the data base object created
	db.session.commit()

//In order to grab object data from database
	model_name.query.filter_by(desired_requirement).first()
					             .all() if you want every entry

//In order to udpate an entry
	obj.name = new_name	obj = model_name.query.filter_by() needs to be performed first before making changes
	db.session.commit() 		make sure to commit after every change

//More advanced queries
	.delete() in order to delete an object in the database
	can only delete one at a time, need to loop in order to delete multiple
